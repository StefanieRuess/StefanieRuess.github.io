## About Me

I am a research associate in the ERC-project DEMOLAW (The design, creation and survival of democratic laws) at the Chair of Prof. Dr. Steffen Hurka at Zeppelin University and a PhD candidate at the University of Konstanz. In my dissertation project, I developed the media-driven discrimination cycle, investigating how regional and national news coverage of immigration-related issues influence the decision-making of public officials in welfare offices. With the new position in the ERC-project, I focus on analyzing laws and administrative guidance documents with natural language processing methods, combining my interest of policy formulation and implementation.
